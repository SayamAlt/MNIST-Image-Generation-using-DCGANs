## MNIST Digits Image Generation using DCGANs

This project uses Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) to generate images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, specifically focusing on generating the digit '8'. The model was trained to learn the distribution of digit '8' images and generate realistic samples based on this training. This repository includes the code for data preparation, DCGAN model architecture, training process, and visualization of generated results.
